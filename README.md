# Incorporation-model
Micromixing time calculation from micromixing experiments in a stirred tank reactor.

Both model are deposited with their raw functionality in the branches.

If the according micromixing time for an experimental obtained segregation index or triiodide concentration wants to be calculated, please use the MatLab Build-In function **fminsearch**
